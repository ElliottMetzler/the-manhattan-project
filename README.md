## Introduction

Ever find yourself hankering for a drink but too tired to get to the store? We get it, it's been a rough week, it's Friday night, and all you want to do is quickly whip something up based on what you already have in the cabinet. That's where we come in. Our goal with The Manhattan Project is to use data on over 500 cocktails and allow you to search based on what you have handy. The Manhattan Project tool will beam you up with a handy list of delicious drinks containing the liquor you have on hand, along with some descriptive information about their flavor profile generated by (un)supervised machine learning models. Cheers!

## Analysis

## Conclusion

## Reproducability Instructions

__NOTE__: [[Need to think about and verify what the system requirements are. We are going to have requirements for access to cloud buckets to upload the CSVs I think, along with GCP for normal stuff. Perhaps other for an app if we try to run one]]

1) Set-up Instructions:
	* Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
	* Run `cd the-manhattan-project`

2) Instructions to create the database:


3) Instructions to produce figures:

4) Instructions to produce quantitative analysis:
