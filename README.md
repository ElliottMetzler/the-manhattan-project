## Introduction

Ever find yourself hankering for a drink but too tired to get to the store? We get it, it's been a rough week, it's Friday night, and all you want to do is quickly whip something up based on what you already have in the cabinet. That's where we come in. Our goal with The Manhattan Project is to use data on over 500 cocktails and allow you to search based on what you have handy. The Manhattan Project tool will beam you up with a handy list of delicious drinks containing the liquor you have on hand, along with some descriptive information about their flavor profile generated by (un)supervised machine learning models. Cheers!

The remainder of this report is structured as follows: first, we discuss the data used for our analysis and applet; next, we discuss the analytical methods applied to the data to generate profiles and the qualitative representations; finally, we conclude with closing thoughts on limitations of our analyis areas for potential extensions to this project.

## Database

[The Cocktail Database](https://www.thecocktaildb.com/) is "an open, crowd-sourced database of drinks and cocktails from around the world." The online database contains a total of 635 unique drinks ranging from classics like a [Manhattan](https://www.thecocktaildb.com/drink/11008-Manhattan) or a [Martini](https://www.thecocktaildb.com/drink/11728-Martini) to more peculiar concoctions like the [Brain Fart](https://www.thecocktaildb.com/drink/17120-Brain-Fart). It also contains listings for mixed shots like the [Lemon Shot](https://www.thecocktaildb.com/drink/12752-Lemon-Shot) or [Shot-gun](https://www.thecocktaildb.com/drink/16985-Shot-gun). 

Since the Cocktail Database (hereafter "cocktailDB") has a JSON API and richer extraction capabilities with a $2 fee to [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/thedatadb) (not to be confused with [Patron](https://www.patrontequila.com/age-gate/age-gate.html?origin=%2F&flc=homepage&fln=Post_Homepage_Patron)), we purchased full access. We extracted the data using python, wrote schema in Postgres, and used Google Cloud Platform Buckets to upload csv files and import them into our own database.

### Procedure

The first step in retrieving the data from cocktailDB was to query the endpoints based on the first letter of the cocktail of interest. Thus, we looped through the alphabet from A to Z, querying data for each cocktail in the database starting with each letter. Then, we compiled these 26 pieces of output into one data frame and wrote this to a csv.

The second important step in retrieving the data from the cocktailDB was to query for additional cocktails that we had not originally extracted in our A-Z search. We noticed that when searching for "Margarita" specifically we found six entries for various types of margaritas, but when searching by "M" (in our A-Z search), we only found one entry for the base rendition. To ensure we extracted all drinks we possibly could, we queried for additional cocktails [[to be continued]]

With our extensive list of cocktails, we used GCP Buckets to upload the csv files into our own SQL cloud database.

### Data

The raw data contains an entry (row) for each drink and many descriptive features (columns) about that drink. In addition to a unique ID for each drink and the drink name, it contains many classification fields such as the the drink category (i.e. cocktail, shot, punch/party drink, etc.), whether or not the drink is alcoholic and the type of glass this drink typically requires. Furthermore, it contains fields containing written instructions in multiple languages including english, german, french and italian. Most importantly, each cocktail has a set of columns reporting the ingredients required and a corresponding set of columns reporting the measurements of those ingredients. In the raw data, these ingredient measurements are non-standard in format and unit, including entries such as "2 shots", "2L", or "3 parts." Because these measurements are non-standard, this represented the biggest data cleaning effort to make our data useable for analysis.




## Analysis

## Conclusion

## Reproducability Instructions

__NOTE__: [[Need to think about and verify what the system requirements are. We are going to have requirements for access to cloud buckets to upload the CSVs I think, along with GCP for normal stuff. Perhaps other for an app if we try to run one]]

1) Set-up Instructions:
	* Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
	* Run `cd the-manhattan-project`

2) Instructions to create the database:
